I tried really hard to import the csv but I ran into a few issues which I unfortunately couldn't seem to figure out.
Mainly that some node modules don't work in the browser.

Anyways, I manually imported the table and was able to continue from there.

The console displays the league table and all the required fields
- Position and team name
- Games played
- Games won
- Games drawn
- Games lost
- Total points
